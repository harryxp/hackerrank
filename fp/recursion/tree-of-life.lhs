hackerrank doesn't support Literate Haskell files so you need to convert this file via:

  perl -ne 'if (m/^> (.*)$/) {print "$1\n";}' tree-of-life.lhs > tree-of-life.hs

The string should be parsed into one tree, and one tree only.

>   [(tree,"")] -> tree
>   otherwise -> error "Can't parse the tree."

Rule
====

The next state of a cell is determined by itself and 3 neighbors.  This means
that a rule (that describes all the behaviors of a given automaton) only needs
to specify a next state for each possible pattern of 4 cells:

1111 1110 1101 ... 0000

In this problem, this means 1 rules is just 16 pattern-state pairs, and there
are 2^16 possible rules.

> numCellsInNeighborhood = 4
> numStatesForEachCell = 2
> numPatternsForEachRule = numStatesForEachCell^numCellsInNeighborhood  -- 16

Build a rule that goes from cell patterns to True/False.  For example rule 7710 is
"0000" -> False
"0001" -> True
"0010" -> True
"0011" -> True
"0100" -> True
"0101" -> False
"0110" -> False
"0111" -> False
"1000" -> False
"1001" -> True
"1010" -> True
"1011" -> True
"1100" -> True
"1101" -> False
"1110" -> False
"1111" -> False

> type Rule = Map.Map String Bool
>
> buildRule :: Int -> Rule
> buildRule ruleNum =
>   let values :: [Bool]
>       values = map (=='1') (printf "%016b" ruleNum)
>       keys :: [String]
>       keys = map (printf "%04b") ([numPatternsForEachRule-1,numPatternsForEachRule-2..0]::[Int])
>   in Map.fromList (zip keys values)

Misc
====

> impossible :: a
> impossible = error "This cannot happen."
