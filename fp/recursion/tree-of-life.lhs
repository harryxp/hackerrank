The `show` function ignores parents to avoid indefinite loops.

> instance Show Tree where
>   show (Branch { value = v, left = l, right = r, parent = _ }) =
>     printf "Branch { value = %s, left = %s, right %s }" (show v) (show l) (show r)
>   show (Leaf { value = v, parent = _ }) = printf "Leaf { value = %s }" (show v)
>   show Nil = "Nil"

The string should be parsed into one tree, and one tree only.

Rule
====

The next state of a cell is determined by itself and 3 neighbors.  This means
that a rule (that describes all the behaviors of a given automaton) only needs
to specify a next state for each possible pattern of 4 cells:

1111 1110 1101 ... 0000

In this problem, this means 1 rules is just 16 pattern-state pairs, and there
are 2^16 possible rules.

> numCellsInNeighborhood = 4
> numStatesForEachCell = 2
> numPatternsForEachRule = numStatesForEachCell^numCellsInNeighborhood  -- 16

Build a rule that goes from cell patterns to True/False.  For example rule 7710 is
"0000" -> False
"0001" -> True
"0010" -> True
"0011" -> True
"0100" -> True
"0101" -> False
"0110" -> False
"0111" -> False
"1000" -> False
"1001" -> True
"1010" -> True
"1011" -> True
"1100" -> True
"1101" -> False
"1110" -> False
"1111" -> False
