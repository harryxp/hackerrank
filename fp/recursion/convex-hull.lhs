This implements the Quickhull algorithm.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickhull.

One thing that helped debugging was plotting the points to visually check the convex hull.  To do so, fire up gnuplot and do something like:

  plot "convex-hull-test-2-plot.txt"
  plot "convex-hull-test-2-plot.txt" using 1:2:(sprintf("(%d, %d)", $1, $2)) with labels notitle

Also, hackerrank doesn't support Literate Haskell files so you need to convert this file via:

  perl -ne 'if (m/^> (.*)$/) {print "$1\n";}' convex-hull.lhs > convex-hull.hs

TODO could use a faster thing than maximumBy

> type Point = (Int,Int)
> type Line = (Point,Point)

> solve :: [Point] -> Double
> solve = perimeter . quickHull

Entrance of the Quickhull algorithm.  Basically prepare the data for recursion in findHull.

Note the way we arrange leftmost and rightmost points - it's crucial to do this so that the points are arranged clockwise.

Also note that the points that are on the convex hull but "sandwiched" between others are not included.

> quickHull :: [Point] -> [Point]
> quickHull points =
>   let
>     leftmost = minimum points   -- lower left when there's a tie
>     rightmost = maximum points  -- upper right when there's a tie
>     line :: Line
>     line = (leftmost,rightmost)
>     (leftHalf,rightHalf) =  -- the line divides the convex hull
>       partition (isToTheLeftOf line) $ filter (isNotOn line) points
>   in
>     (leftmost:findHull leftHalf line True) ++
>     (rightmost:findHull rightHalf line False)

Decide the point's position relative to the line.

Recursively find the hull.  shouldSearchLeftward is used to guide:
1. Which direction should we look for the farthest point, and
2. How the points should be arranged to be clockwise.

> findHull [] _ _ = []
> findHull pts line@(ptLeft,ptRight) shouldSearchLeftward =
>   let
>     farthest = maximumBy (compareDistances line) pts
>     newLine1 = (ptLeft,farthest)
>     newLine2 = (farthest,ptRight)
>     pred = if shouldSearchLeftward then isToTheLeftOf else isToTheRightOf
>     newPts1 = filter (pred newLine1) pts
>     newPts2 = filter (pred newLine2) pts
>   in
>     if shouldSearchLeftward
>     then findHull newPts1 newLine1 shouldSearchLeftward ++ (farthest:findHull newPts2 newLine2 shouldSearchLeftward)

Compare the distances of p1 and p2 to a line.

> compareDistances :: Line -> Point -> Point -> Ordering
> compareDistances line p1 p2 =
>   compare (distanceToLine line p1) (distanceToLine line p2)

Copied from ../introduction/polygon-perimeter.hs.  It assumes that the points are ordered clockwise or counterclockwise.

> perimeter :: [Point] -> Double
> perimeter (x:xs) = snd $

>     distance :: Point -> Point -> Double
>     distance p1 p2 = sqrt . fromIntegral $
>       (fst p2 - fst p1) ^ 2 + (snd p2 - snd p1) ^ 2
> perimeter [] = error "This cannot happen."
